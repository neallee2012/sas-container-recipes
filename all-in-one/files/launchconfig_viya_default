# CAS Launcher Configuration
#
# The file must start with the first line as shown in this
# prototype file. Setting names are case-insensitive.

#
# Specify the location of the CAS shell script. The first
# argument to the shell script is the location of the CAS
# executable. All options specified to the launcher as well
# as options specified at runtime by a launch request from
# CAS main will be added to this command line.
# This is a MANDATORY setting.
#
server=CASLAUNCH/cas.sh CASLAUNCH/cas

#
# Specify the location of the launcher log file. Formatting
# allows for a string substitution which will be replaced
# by the hostname and a numeric substiution which will be
# replaced by the PID. This is an optional setting.
#
# log=/opt/sas/viya/config/var/log/cas/default/caslaunch_%s_%d.log

#
# Specify the level of logging required. This log level will
# apply to all logs specified in the configuration file. Valid
# levels are "info" and "debug", case-insensitive. Optional.
# The default is "info".
#
# logLevel=debug

#
# Specify the location of the CAS Launch Services log file.
# Formatting allows for a string substitution which will be
# replaced by the hostname and a numeric substiution which
# will be replaced by the PID. This is an optional setting.
#
# launchLog=/opt/sas/viya/config/var/log/cas/default/launchsvcs_%s_%d.log

#
# The launch of the CAS server should be done using the supplied
# host identity (POSIX identity). This requires that the launcher
# is run as root. If this option is set, and there is no host token
# supplied obtained by client authentication, then the launch will
# fail.
#
useHostToken

#
# When specifying useHostToken, POSIX attributes must be supplied
# via host authentication (PAM or kerberos) in order to launch a session
# process. It is possible to allow a mixed deployment where POSIX users
# launch under POSIX identity, but non-POSIX users (OAuth2) run under
# the service account used to run caslaunch.
#
launchUsingServiceIdentity

#
# When running as root, specify this option to restrict who is
# allowed to run caslaunch to start a server. If this is not
# specified, anyone can start a server. If caslaunch is not running
# as root, this option is ignored.
#
restrictServerLaunch=cas

#
# An external identity provider, identsvcs, is used to perform
# user authentication. This is typically used when root access is
# required for authentication. This utilizes an external PAM provider
# process for authentication. Of course, if root access is required
# for authentication, the launcher must be running as root. In addition,
# the external authentication provider should be configured for use by
# the CAS server.
#
externalIdent

#
# Specify the location of the CAS Identity Services log file.
# Formatting allows for a string substitution which will be
# replaced by the hostname and a numeric substiution which
# will be replaced by the PID. This is an optional setting.
#
# identLog=/opt/sas/viya/config/var/log/cas/default/identsvcs_%s_%d.log
